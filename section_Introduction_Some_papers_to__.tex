\section{Introduction}

Some papers to cite: paper containing the algorithms for reduced basis and interpolant generation
\citep{Field_2014}, paper containing the description of enriching the basis and a basis for the quadratic terms
\citep{2016arXiv160408253S}.

Discuss the current known pulsar search and why using reduced order quadrature to speed up likelihood evaluations could be uesful.
