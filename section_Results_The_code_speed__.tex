\section{Results}

The code speed-up needs to tested in a variety of scenarios: searches purely over frequency parameters, searches over frequency and sky position, and searches also covering binary parameters. These need to span different lengths of data (although a single maximum chunk length could be used and scaled for practicality) and have different sizes of parameter spaces.
